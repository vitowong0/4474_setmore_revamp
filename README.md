# SetmoreRevamp
Final project for Computer Science 4474 - Human Computer Interaction, at Western University.

Our project is to revamp the user's experience with _Setmore_, a popular service booking app. At the moment, they lack a customer app - so we are creating one.

## Installation
We are using React Native for cross-platform functionality. We set up our app using the instructions for _React Native CLI Quickstart_.

Follow the documentation here: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

Ensure the test app is functional before moving onto the next steps.

## Usage
1. In your IDE of choice, we used Visual Studio Code, `cd` into `./SetmoreRevamp`.

2. Open a new terminal of your choice within VSCode and run `npx react-native start`. Assuming you followed the environment-setup documentation, the Metro bundler should begin. This terminal will show all warnings and errors, and any console.log() will appear here.

3. iOS simualtor: Open another new terminal within VSCode and run `npx react-native run-ios`.

4. Android simulator: Open another new terminal within VSCode and run `npx react-native run-android`.

5. Your simulator should begin and our app should launch onto its Home screen.
